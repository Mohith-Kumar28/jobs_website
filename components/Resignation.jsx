            <p className="leading-relaxed">It's essential to know your market value. It will assist you in determining whether the compensation at your current work or any new job offers is fair. Knowing where there is a need for your abilities can help you bargain hard with a potential employer. It could give you more certainty that you're doing morally. Knowing your value might even help you anticipate the flow of your resignation after you make the decision to leave.</p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">A strong resignation letter will be succinct, formal, and show good faith. Once it has been filed and accepted, you cannot withdraw it without your employer's permission. The intent is to formally notify your employer in writing that you will be leaving the organisation and specify the date of your departure. Mention in the letter any verbal offers they may have made, such as gardening leave. This can shield you from any potential conflicts in the future.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It can also assist you in parting amicably: Declare that you'll maintain your professionalism throughout the notice period. Additionally, it gives you a chance to recognise and appreciate those who have helped you at the business. </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">Every employment agreement has a notice clause. This is the period of time after you've notified your employer that you're resigning during which you can still work. It exists so that the business has time to prepare for life after you leave. Your notice period will often be longer the more valuable you are.
            <br/>
            <br/>
It's customary practise in several businesses to put an employee on "gardening leave" when they join a competitor. You will continue to be paid by your firm and get benefits, but you are unable to work for them or switch jobs. It serves as a barrier to prevent you from taking business relationships, clients, or intellectual property with you when you depart.</p>

            <h2 className="font-medium title-font text-sm text-gray-900 mb-1 tracking-wider">Transition Game</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">Working your notice may be uncomfortable, even if you are leaving on friendly terms. Everyone will find it simpler if there is a transition strategy in place. You might not receive any new projects to work on, and your duties might be reduced. You might need to personally train a replacement in some circumstances. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Your company can decide to restrict your access if you deal with sensitive data or have close customer ties. This is a preventative strategy to stop you from giving sensitive client information or customers to competitors. Don't take it personally; this is usual procedure. Your presence may make your coworkers uncomfortable or inquisitive. The most important things to keep in mind are to stay respectful and professional.</p>
